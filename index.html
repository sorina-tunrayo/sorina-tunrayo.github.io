        <h1>Out of Halls</h1>
        

        <h2>The movement</h2> 
        <p>As a new memeber of the Oxford (make this stand out) graduate community (make this standout), I have been overwhelmed by the huge number of activities that the colleges and the Universities provide. Out of Halls is supposed to represent the act of leaving</p>

        <p>So you're are a newbie to Oxford, you want to make a name for yourself as the ultimate cool kid (or at least make a friend or two) or old timer wishing to reignite your love of this wondrous city. This not so complete guide is for you and also for you to complete. </p>
